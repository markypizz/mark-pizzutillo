          </h2>

            Hello! I'm Mark. I'm a 22 year old software engineer currently residing in
            Austin, TX. Currently I work for IBM, writing code for DRAM initialization
            on IBM Power & Z Systems. </br> </br>

            I grew up in southern New Jersey, and graduated from The Pennsylvania State
            University in 3.5 years with a B.S. in Computer Engineering, and a minor
            in Music Performance. In my time at Penn State, I worked as a undergraduate
            research assistant in the Penn State Mobile Computing and Networking laboratory,
            where I found a side-passion for writing mobile apps (more on that later!). 
            During some phenomenal courses, I was fortunate to work on a variety of projects
            ranging from an FPGA CPU, to operating system components in C and x86,
            to iOS Applications in Swift, to an Arduino-powered water-piping system, and so 
            much more. </br> </br>

            Outside of work & school, I have an obsession with learning new areas of computer 
            science and engineering. I have written 2 sizeable iOS applications, a 3D Chess game
            and a musician's toolkit including a metronome, tuner, and audio recorder. On the
            other side of that coin, I've spent some time learning Ionic+Angular, with plans to
            hopefully write a cross-platform app of some kind, either with that, or with React
            Native, Flutter, or wherever the wind takes me. I've spent some time trying to learn
            languages I don't work with normally, such as Swift (which I love), Go, HTML/CSS/JS.
            However, my bread & butter will always be C/C++, and Java. </br></br>

            One of my more recent endeavors is to revisit my old FPGA CPU project, but re-do
            it. I've begun writing my own basic ISA, implement this in a SystemVerilog CPU, and
            will have it read/write data to/from an NVRAM dip. All of this will just be implemented
            on breadboards for the time being. Some long-term plans may include keyboard support
            and some kind of shell to write basic programs. </br></br>

            Rants aside, hope you enjoy my latest endeavor, creating a website :-)</br>
            Not everything here is from scratch, but it's a good introduction for me into 
            HTML/CSS.  </br>
            
            Check out my resume and my projects page for more information about me.
